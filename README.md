# To The Pass

## Problem Statement

I find a great disparity between the synchronous nature of listed recipes and the complete chaos of cooking at home. I love cooking, but I don't like having to remember exactly when to do things to make sure all parts of a recipe are complete when they're need (i.e. nothing's done too late or _too early_). This issue is further compounded by having multiple recipes within a meal. In most cases, if your recipe isn't the entire meal, you have to mentally balance timing to complete everything at once.

This problem is not the worst one out there. It can be solved by tracking the recipes internally, creating a spreadsheet, updating your own notes, etc. But it would be really nice if, within one application, I could:
1. Aggregate all of my separate recipes and tasks during a session of cooking into a single, __clean__, interface.
2. Pull recipes from the web and other apps into this centralized location.
3. See a relative recommendation for when each task should begin. Ideally, it should take the number of cooks into account to know the latest possible time each task can be started to put everything on the plate at the same time.
